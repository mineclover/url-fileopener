# Performance Targets

> 🎯 **성능 목표 및 벤치마크 정의**

## 📋 개요

Effect CLI 큐 시스템의 성능 목표, 벤치마크, 그리고 측정 기준을 정의합니다.

## 🎯 Performance Goals

### Primary Objectives
- **High Throughput**: 초당 1000+ 작업 처리
- **Low Latency**: 평균 응답 시간 < 3ms
- **High Availability**: 99.9% 가용성 보장
- **Resource Efficiency**: 메모리 사용량 최적화

### Secondary Objectives
