# File Opening Behavior Testing

This document describes how to test the file opening behavior of the fileopener CLI tool.

## üß™ Test Files

The `test-files/` directory contains various file types for testing:

| File | Type | Expected Behavior |
|------|------|------------------|
| `test.js` | JavaScript | Opens in text editor (VS Code, etc.) |
| `test.sh` | Shell Script | Opens in text editor (NOT executed) |
| `test.bat` | Windows Batch | Opens in text editor (NOT executed) |
| `test.md` | Markdown | Opens in text editor or markdown viewer |
| `test.json` | JSON | Opens in text editor |
| `test.png` | PNG Image | Opens in image viewer |
| `test.pdf` | PDF Document | Opens in PDF viewer |

## üöÄ Quick Test

### Automated Test Script

Run the automated test script:

```bash
./test-file-opening.sh
```

This script will:
1. Add the test project
2. Test each file type
3. Ask for your feedback on each test
4. Clean up the test project

### Manual Testing

#### 1. Setup Test Project

```bash
# Add test project
fopen add testproject $(pwd)/test-files

# Verify it was added
fopen list
```

#### 2. Test Individual Files

```bash
# Test JavaScript file
fopen open "fileopener://testproject/test.js"

# Test shell script (should NOT execute)
fopen open "fileopener://testproject/test.sh"

# Test Windows batch file (should NOT execute)
fopen open "fileopener://testproject/test.bat"

# Test markdown file
fopen open "fileopener://testproject/test.md"

# Test JSON file
fopen open "fileopener://testproject/test.json"

# Test image file
fopen open "fileopener://testproject/test.png"

# Test PDF file
fopen open "fileopener://testproject/test.pdf"
```

#### 3. Cleanup

```bash
# Remove test project
fopen remove testproject
```

## üîç What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Expected Behaviors

- **Text Files** (`.js`, `.md`, `.json`): Open in your default text editor
- **Script Files** (`.sh`, `.bat`): Open in text editor for viewing (NOT executed)
- **Images** (`.png`): Open in your default image viewer
- **PDFs** (`.pdf`): Open in your default PDF viewer

### ‚ùå Security Checks

- **Scripts should NOT execute**: `.sh` and `.bat` files should open in a text editor
- **No system commands**: No terminal windows should open unexpectedly
- **Safe viewing only**: Files should open for viewing/editing, not execution

### üñ•Ô∏è Platform-Specific Notes

#### macOS
- Uses `open` command
- Text files typically open in VS Code, Sublime Text, or TextEdit
- Images open in Preview
- PDFs open in Preview

#### Windows
- Uses `start` command
- Behavior depends on default applications
- Scripts should open in Notepad or VS Code (not execute)

#### Linux
- Uses `xdg-open` command
- Behavior depends on installed applications and desktop environment
- Scripts should open in text editor (not execute)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### File Doesn't Open

1. **Check project configuration**:
   ```bash
   fopen list
   ```

2. **Verify file exists**:
   ```bash
   ls -la test-files/
   ```

3. **Test with absolute path**:
   ```bash
   fopen open "fileopener://testproject/test.js"
   ```

### Script Executes Instead of Opening

‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a security issue!**

1. Check your system's default applications
2. Verify the fileopener CLI is working correctly
3. Report this as a bug

### Wrong Application Opens

1. Check your system's default file associations
2. This is normal behavior - the tool uses system defaults
3. You can change default applications in system settings

## üîí Security Notes

The fileopener CLI is designed with security in mind:

- **No Execution**: Script files are opened for viewing, not execution
- **Path Validation**: All paths are validated to prevent directory traversal
- **Project Boundaries**: Files can only be accessed within configured project directories
- **Safe Defaults**: Uses system default applications rather than custom execution logic

If you observe any behavior that contradicts these security principles, please report it as a bug.
