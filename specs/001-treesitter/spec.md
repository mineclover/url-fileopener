# Feature Specification: File-based Dependency Analysis Module

**Feature Branch**: `001-treesitter`  
**Created**: 2025-09-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "파일 단위의 의존성 분석을 고유한 영역으로 만든다 그냥 파일 단위로 코드들 분석하고 의존성을 잇는 작업을 수행하기 위한 파싱 모듈을 만든다 이를 위해 코드를 treesitter 로 파싱한다 파싱 모듈은 자신이 파일에서 무엇을 찾는지 집중하도록 구성한다 다양한 파일 포멧과 요구사항들이 있기 때문에 효율적으로 파싱할 수 있도록 파서와 파서가 얻어낸 데이터를 해석하는 모듈을 따로 만든다"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to analyze a source file to identify its dependencies on other modules, so that I can understand the code structure and relationships.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a TypeScript file with `import` statements, **When** the analysis module processes it, **Then** it should output a list of imported module specifiers.
2. **Given** a configuration specifying to look for function calls to a certain API, **When** the analysis module processes a file, **Then** it should identify all call sites of that API.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there are syntax errors in the source file?
- How does the system handle dynamic imports (e.g., `import('...')`)?
- What is the behavior for unsupported file formats?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST parse source code files using `tree-sitter`.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST allow configuring the parser to extract specific code constructs (e.g., import statements, function calls).
- **FR-003**: The system MUST separate the parsing logic (the "parser") from the data interpretation logic (the "interpreter").
- **FR-004**: The system MUST provide a clear interface to receive a file path and return its identified dependencies.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST initially support TypeScript files.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST handle parsing errors gracefully. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the desired graceful handling? Should it skip the file, return a specific error, or attempt a partial analysis?]
- **FR-007**: The system MUST support various file formats and requirements efficiently. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What other file formats are priorities after TypeScript? What are the performance expectations?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Parser**: Responsible for taking a file and a configuration, and producing a syntax tree or extracted raw data using `tree-sitter`.
- **Interpreter**: Responsible for taking the raw data from the Parser and building a structured representation, such as a dependency list or a map of code constructs.
- **Parse Configuration**: An object or file that defines which language to use and what specific syntax nodes or patterns the Parser should look for.
- **Dependency**: A data structure representing a link from the analyzed file to another module or entity.
