# Phase 0 Research: Tree-sitter Parser Module

## 1. Tree-sitter Best Practices for TypeScript in Node.js

*   **Decision**: Use the official `tree-sitter` and `tree-sitter-typescript` packages. The parser will be loaded dynamically.
*   **Rationale**: The official packages are well-maintained and provide the necessary bindings for Node.js. Dynamic loading of language grammars (`.wasm` files) is efficient and allows for supporting multiple languages in the future.
*   **Alternatives Considered**: None, as this is the standard approach.

## 2. Parallelization Strategy for Tree-sitter in Node.js

*   **Decision**: Utilize Node.js `worker_threads` to run parsing tasks in parallel. A main thread will manage a pool of workers and distribute file parsing jobs.
*   **Rationale**: `tree-sitter`'s parsing process is CPU-bound. Running it in the main Node.js event loop would block other operations. `worker_threads` provide true parallelism for CPU-intensive tasks, making it a perfect fit for our requirement of a "parallelizable code parser". Each worker can instantiate its own parser, load a file's content, and parse it without interfering with other workers.
*   **Alternatives Considered**:
    *   **Child Processes**: Heavier than worker threads, with more overhead for communication. Not ideal for this use case.
    *   **Asynchronous iteration on the main thread**: This would not be truly parallel and would still block the event loop during the parsing of each file.

## 3. Performance Goals

*   **Decision**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] A specific target (e.g., 10,000 lines/sec per core) needs to be defined based on expected workload. For now, the goal is to be significantly faster than a sequential implementation.
*   **Rationale**: Without a clear performance target, it's hard to measure success. However, the primary goal is parallelization, which will inherently improve throughput.
*   **Alternatives Considered**: N/A.
