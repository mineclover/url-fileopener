# Feature Specification: File Opener CLI Tool

**Feature Branch**: `002-file-opener-demo`
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "file-opener-demo Ìè¥ÎçîÏùò ÎÇ¥Ïö©ÏùÑ Í∏∞Î∞òÏúºÎ°ú cliÎ•º Íµ¨ÏÑ±ÌïòÎ†§Ìï¥ ../../src Ïì∞Îäî Íµ¨Í∞ÑÏùÄ npm install git+https://github.com/mineclover/protocol-registry.git Î•º Ïç®ÏÑú ÏÑ§ÏπòÎêú protocol-registry Î•º Ïì∞Î©¥ Îê®"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Convert file-opener-demo to CLI tool using protocol-registry package
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Developers/users wanting to open files via custom URL scheme
   ‚Üí Actions: Register protocol, manage project configurations, open files
   ‚Üí Data: Project aliases, file paths, configuration settings
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must use external protocol-registry package instead of local src
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí CLI command name needs to be finalized (considering abbreviated form)
   ‚Üí Installation method and global availability requirements
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary: User installs CLI, registers protocol, adds projects, opens files
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement covers CLI commands, protocol handling, configuration
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí CLI commands, Project configurations, Protocol registrations
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Implementation details minimized, focus on user value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer wants to create clickable links that open specific files in their local editor directly from web pages, documentation, or shared links. They need a way to register a custom URL scheme (`fileopener://`), configure project aliases for their local directories, and seamlessly open files without manually navigating file systems.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the CLI tool is installed globally, **When** a user runs `fopen install`, **Then** the `fileopener://` protocol is registered with the operating system
2. **Given** the protocol is registered, **When** a user runs `fopen add myproject /path/to/project`, **Then** the project alias is stored and can be used in URLs
3. **Given** a project is configured, **When** a user clicks or opens `fileopener://myproject/src/index.js`, **Then** the file opens in their default editor
4. **Given** multiple projects are configured, **When** a user runs `fopen list`, **Then** all configured project aliases and paths are displayed
5. **Given** a project is no longer needed, **When** a user runs `fopen remove myproject`, **Then** the project alias is removed from configuration

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to open a file that doesn't exist in the configured project?
- How does the system handle attempts to access files outside the project directory (path traversal security)?
- What occurs when the protocol is already registered by another application?
- How does the system behave when configuration files are corrupted or missing?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a command-line interface for managing the file opener functionality
- **FR-002**: System MUST be installable as a global npm package for easy CLI access
- **FR-003**: System MUST register the `fileopener://` custom URL scheme with the operating system
- **FR-004**: System MUST support adding project aliases that map to local directory paths
- **FR-005**: System MUST support removing project aliases from configuration
- **FR-006**: System MUST list all currently configured project aliases and their paths
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle `fileopener://projectname/path/to/file` URLs to open specific files
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate that requested file paths remain within the configured project boundaries (security)
- **FR-009**: System MUST use the external `protocol-registry` package instead of local source dependencies
- **FR-010**: System MUST create and manage configuration files in the user's home directory (`~/.protocol-registry/`)
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide clear error messages for invalid configurations or missing files
- **FR-012**: System MUST support both legacy query parameter format (`?path=`) and modern path-based format
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle URL decoding for special characters in file paths
- **FR-014**: System MUST log operations for debugging purposes to `~/.protocol-registry/log.txt`
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide JSDoc type hints for better developer experience
- **FR-016**: System MUST support protocol deregistration for clean uninstallation via `fopen uninstall` command

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **CLI Commands**: Installation, project management, protocol registration/deregistration commands using `fopen` as the CLI tool name
- **Project Configuration**: Mapping of project aliases to absolute file system paths, stored in JSON format
- **URL Handler**: Component that processes `fileopener://` URLs and translates them to local file operations
- **Protocol Registration**: System-level registration that associates `fileopener://` scheme with the handler
